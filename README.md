# DA_2023_Project

Welcome to the **DA_2023_Project** repository! This repository contains the code and resources for our data analysis project for the year 2023.

## Description

The **DA_2023_Project** is a data analysis project that aims to analyze a specific dataset or problem using various data analysis techniques. The goal of this project is to gain insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and present the findings to the intended audience.

The dataset consists of data collected from heavy Scania trucks in everyday usage. The system in
focus is the Air Pressure system (APS) which generates pressurized air that is utilized in various
functions in a truck, such as braking and gear changes. The datasetsâ€™ positive class consists of
component failures for a specific component of the APS system. The negative class consists of trucks
with failures for components not related to the APS. The data consists of a subset of all available
data, selected by experts.

The training set contains 60000 examples in total of which 59000 belong to the negative class
and 1000 positive class. The test set contains 16000 examples. There are 171 attributes per record
